# Automated-Irrigation
The code to make the automated dashboard ("get_googlesheets_data.py" and "irrigation_dashboard") was used in conjunction with wayscript, an online editor that allows users to integrate different web sources and coding languages. Therefore, there might be some holes or missing code that was only on wayscript.
